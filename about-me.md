## About me
I'm a lifelong learner who likes to apply technology to solve business
Problems.

I've spent most of my career so far in the Enterprise IT industry,
building and deploying business applications using mostly Enterprise
Middleware software.

For the last 20 years, I've worked primarily with Enterprise Java-
based solutions built and deployed to Large Government and
Corporate commercial organizations. During this journey, I've worked
in different roles, from application design and programming using
the Enterprise Java ecosystem to system administration, deploying
and maintaining Linux based systems and servers hosting Enterprise
Applications. For the last ten years, I've been working as a Specialist
Solution Architect at Red Hat, where I had the opportunity to help
many customers modernize their applications to run on hybrid cloud-
based infrastructures leveraging cloud-native technologies and
principles like GitOps and DevSecOps. In this context, I've been
helping customers to migrate existing applications to container-based
environments. 

At the moment, I'm interested in leveraging and deepening my
technical skills in Platform Engineering, building Internal Developer
Portals, Deployment Automation, Continuous Integration and
Continuous Deployment, Container Orchestration, Cloud-native Java
Stacks, and Application Monitoring and Observability.

* **Tools and tech stacks**: Enterprise Java, Git, Developer Tooling, Kubernetes, Linux Containers,
Red Hat OpenShift, Ansible Automation.

* **Programming Languages**: Java, Bash scripts, JavaScript, Python... I'm up for
learning whatever makes the most sense in context.

experimenting with or working with.
